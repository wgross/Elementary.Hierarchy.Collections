# Elementary.Hierarchy.Collections

The Elementary.Hierarchy.Collections provides data strautures for storeing arbitrary data in an tree-structured data strcuture.
The straucture of the tree isn't balanced but instead follows the path-like identifier like a file system does. 
Therefore I named it an 'Hierarchy' but not a tree.
